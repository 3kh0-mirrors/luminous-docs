## Here's what we've done

1. We moved Dynamics bundle files into `public/dynamic/` directory. 
2. We have modified the path in the config to match the new directory structure.
3. We created a service worker and scoped it to the appropriate `/service/` path.
4. We registered the service worker in our JavaScript file.
5. Boom. That's it. You're done.
